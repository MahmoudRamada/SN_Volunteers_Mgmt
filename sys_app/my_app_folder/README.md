# Volunteer Management Scoped App

## Structure
- `application.xml`: Application manifest

## Instructions
1. Import each XML into your ServiceNow scoped app (via Update Set or App Repository).

3. Extend flows, UI, ACLs, and notifications as needed.  
4. Create Flow Designer flows to orchestrate onboarding and assignments.
